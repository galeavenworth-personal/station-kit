# Legacy: Refactor Workflow (Monolithic)

This is a **reference-only** legacy workflow describing a monolithic `/refactor` style process.

This kit’s preferred approach is the orchestrated refactor workflow:
- [`orchestrate-refactor.md`](../orchestrate-refactor.md)

## Notes
- This file is intentionally minimal: the kit is template-only and does not ship runtime logic.
- If your project does not support refactor automation, treat this as a documentation reference, not an executable workflow.
