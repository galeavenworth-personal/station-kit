# Beads Directory (Template)

This directory is a minimal **template** to help bootstrap Beads usage in a new repository.

## Important

- The Station Kit does **not** install Beads.
- You must install the `bd` CLI and initialize/configure it for your repository.

## What this template provides

- [`implementation-guides/`](./implementation-guides/): documents that workflows may link to.
