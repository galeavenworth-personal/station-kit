# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This repository is a template kit (copy/paste docs + templates). There is no runtime service deployed from this repo.

Security support is provided on a best-effort basis for the latest `main` branch content.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

1) Prefer using GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** / **Security Advisories** (if enabled for the repo).
2) If that is not available, open a GitHub issue with **minimal details** and request a private channel.
3) If neither option is workable, email the maintainer at **[galeavenworth+oss@gmail.com](mailto:galeavenworth+oss@gmail.com)** with the subject line:
   Security: Station Kit

### What to include

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (as small as possible)
- Impact assessment (what can go wrong)
- Any suggested mitigations

## Disclosure

Please avoid public disclosure until a fix and release guidance are available.
